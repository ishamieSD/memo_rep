% chop the raw and preprocessed data into R-digestable chunks of cleaned 
% HGP peak outlier-containing time bins (default 2 seconds)
%
% Created by Xi Jiang, Sept. 9th, 2014
%
% Dependencies: outlier_wavedecompC.m
%
% Outputs:
%  data_LFP: 61-by-1 cell containing 61 matrices, each row of which 
%            represents (by default) a 2-second time bin containing at 
%            least one HGP peak outlier that may serve as the bin's center
%  data_HGP: similar to the above, except the data has been
%            bandpass-filtered, hilbert-transformed, turned into z-score,
%        
% Inputs:
%  data_out: one of the outputs of outlier_cleaning.m, with required field
%            "newPOI", representing numerical indices of all HGP peak 
%            outliers
%  data_raw: raw data in matrix form
%  new_starts: one of the outputs from outlier_unifier.m, denoting the
%              starting indices of clean time bins
%  new_ends: similar to the variable above, except containing ends of time
%            bins
%  methods: a structure that contains at least the following fields:
%           -time_bin: integer representing size of time bins, in seconds
%           -sfreq: sampling frequency (in Hz)
